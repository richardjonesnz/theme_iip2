This theme is meant to be an example theme for extending Boost.

It comes with maximum comments for all code and shows how to extend and add settings
to a Boost based theme.

It also looks nice!

Added the preset iip2.scss specifically for this theme
Added a theme setting to display custom text in the header area
of the front page.
